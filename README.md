Implementation of the algorithm to solve the Chain Alignment Problem (CAP) and the three heuristics for the Multiple Chain Alignment Problem (MCAP) in C.

# Compilation and usage
## Compiling CAP
```
cd cap && gcc *.c -o cap
```
Usage: `cap <input_file_1> <input_file_2>`

## Compiling the heuristics for the MCAP:
```
cd mcap_heuristics && gcc *.c -o mcap
```
Usage: `mcap [# of the heuristic] [sequence 1] [sequence 2] ... [sequence n]`
